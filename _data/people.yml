      bio: >
        Fearless leader of the Rose research group!
        I'm passionate about science, education, math, the Earth,
        open-source software, bicycles, building communities,
        music (stringed instruments especially),
        food, drink, and family. When I'm not working, I'm basically a hobbit.

        My research interests include the variability and vertical structure
        of the atmospheric energy transport and its role in polar warming on
        synoptic and climate timescales, and tropospheric-stratospheric coupling.
        Outside of work, I enjoy music, disc golf, second breakfast,
        and identifying trees while hiking.

        I am enthusiastic about climate science in general.
        My research interests include multiple equilibria in the coupled climate
        system and causes of glacial-interglacial cycles.
        Using a hierarchy of climate models and the theories of nonlinear
        dynamical systems, my goal is to understand how every component of the
        climate system has worked together to produce the large climatic
        transitions in the Earth’s history.
        When I’m not working, I enjoy reading, walking, violin and clouds.

        I enjoy understanding the processes related to large-scale climate dynamics and climate change. My research interests include (1) uncertainty in climate sensitivity and its relation to the ocean (2) interactions between ocean, clouds, and radiation (3) time-evolving ocean circulation under climate change.

        I am generally interested in climate change, dynamics, and modeling.
        My current research involves using climate models to investigate the
        pattern effect, which refers to the coupling of patterns of
        ocean heat uptake (and sea surface temperature), radiative feedbacks,
        and climate sensitivity. Besides science, I enjoy playing guitar, bass,
        and video games, as well as reading fantasy and philosophy.

        I have a strong interest in the processes and feedbacks taking place in
        the atmosphere and ocean. Currently, I focus on the rapid warming taking
        place over the desert. My goal is to explore the mechanisms responsible
        for it and the impacts this warming has on the regional and global climate.
        In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, travelling and photography.

        I am interested in synoptic dynamics, land atmosphere interation,and
        extreme precipitaion events in general. Currently, I am working in identifying
        and attributing changes in the ratio of locally forced 
        and synoptically forced midlatitudes precipitaion events
        using satellite remote sensing. In my spare time, I like playing tennis, hiking,
        and watching sports..
