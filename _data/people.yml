      bio: >
        Fearless leader of the Rose research group!
        I'm passionate about science, education, math, the Earth,
        open-source software, bicycles, building communities,
        music (stringed instruments especially),
        food, drink, and family. When I'm not working, I'm basically a hobbit.

        I am generally interested in global climate change and large-scale dynamics. 
        My current research uses climate models to explore how atmosphere–ocean–sea ice 
        interactions influence radiative feedbacks and climate sensitivity. In particular, 
        I am interested in how slow variability of the Southern Ocean could impact 
        radiative feedbacks through pattern effects. Besides science, I enjoy playing 
        guitar and reading philosophy.

        I have a strong interest in the processes and feedbacks taking place in
        the atmosphere and ocean. Currently, I focus on the rapid warming taking
        place over the desert. My goal is to explore the mechanisms responsible
        for it and the impacts this warming has on the regional and global climate.
        In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, travelling and photography.

        I am interested in synoptic dynamics, land atmosphere interaction,and
        extreme precipitation events in general. Currently, I am working in identifying
        and attributing changes in the ratio of locally forced 
        and synoptically forced midlatitude precipitation events
        using satellite remote sensing. In my spare time, I like playing tennis, hiking,
        and watching sports.

        I have an interest in severe storms meteorology, in particular the 
        processes that cause the genesis and strengthening of tornadoes. 
        My current research involves the analysis of the Turin, NY tornado 
        of 2023, specifically the roll of terrain and storm interactions 
        in the progression of the tornado. Outside of science, 
        I enjoy skiing, working out, and volunteering with my 
        local fire department.
